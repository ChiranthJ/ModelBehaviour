# Bug Fixes Summary for Costa Rican Household Poverty Prediction Project

## Overview
This document summarizes three critical bugs found in the codebase and provides detailed explanations of the problems and their solutions.

## Bug 1: Variable Name Conflict in Upsampling Notebook

**File**: `Upsampling Minority Classes.ipynb`

**Problem Description**:
The variable `upsampled` is used for two different purposes:
1. The upsampled dataset (correct usage)
2. The fitted LogisticRegression model (incorrect usage)

This creates a critical variable name conflict where the original dataset is overwritten by the model object, causing:
- Loss of the upsampled dataset
- Confusion in code execution
- Potential runtime errors when trying to access dataset properties

**Code Location**:
```python
# Line ~50: Dataset creation
upsampled = pd.concat([majority, minority_upsampled1, minority_upsampled2, minority_upsampled3])

# Line ~55: Model fitting (BUG: overwrites the dataset)
upsampled = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear').fit(x_train, y_train)

# Line ~56: Prediction (BUG: tries to call predict on dataset instead of model)
upsampled_pred = upsampled.predict(x_test)
```

**Impact**: 
- The upsampled dataset is lost after model fitting
- The prediction line will fail because `upsampled` is now a model, not a dataset
- Code becomes unreadable and confusing

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Fixed version
upsampled = pd.concat([majority, minority_upsampled1, minority_upsampled2, minority_upsampled3])

# Use descriptive variable name for the model
logistic_model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear').fit(x_train, y_train)

# Now prediction works correctly
upsampled_pred = logistic_model.predict(x_test)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- No data loss
- Improved code readability
- Prevents runtime errors

## Bug 2: Hardcoded File Paths (Portability Issue)

**Files Affected**:
- `Analysis.ipynb`
- `Sample_testing_models_phase1.ipynb`
- `Sample_testing_models_phase2.ipynb`

**Problem Description**:
Multiple notebooks contain hardcoded Windows file paths that:
- Will fail on non-Windows operating systems
- Make the code non-portable
- Create dependency on specific user directory structures
- Break when files are moved to different locations

**Examples of Hardcoded Paths**:
```python
# Windows-specific paths that will fail on other systems
processeddata = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\rames\OneDrive\Desktop\namma\DA_proj\preprocessed_wosq.csv')
train = read.csv('C:\\Users\\rames\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\namma\\DA_proj\\costa-rican-household-prediction (1)\\train.csv')
```

**Impact**:
- Code cannot run on Linux, macOS, or other Windows machines
- Collaboration becomes difficult
- Code is not reproducible across different environments
- Professional code quality is compromised

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Before (hardcoded)
processeddata = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\rames\OneDrive\Desktop\namma\DA_proj\preprocessed_wosq.csv')

# After (relative path)
processeddata = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_wosq.csv')

# Before (hardcoded)
train = read.csv('C:\\Users\\rames\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\namma\\DA_proj\\costa-rican-household-prediction (1)\\train.csv')

# After (relative path)
train = read.csv('RawData/train.csv')
```

**Benefits**:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Improved portability
- Better collaboration potential
- Professional code standards
- Easier deployment and sharing

## Bug 3: Missing Import and Undefined Variable

**File**: `Sample_testing_models_phase2.ipynb`

**Problem Description**:
The notebook contains two critical issues:
1. **Missing Import**: Attempts to import from a non-existent module
2. **Undefined Variable**: References a variable `df` that is never defined

**Code Issues**:
```python
# Issue 1: Non-existent import
from ipynb.fs.full.PCA_analysis import *

# Issue 2: Undefined variable 'df'
zero_cols = [ col for col, is_zero in ((df == 0).sum() == df.shape[0]).items() if is_zero ]
```

**Impact**:
- Import error will prevent the notebook from running
- Reference to undefined variable `df` will cause NameError
- Code execution will fail completely
- Poor error handling and debugging experience

**Root Cause**:
- The import statement suggests the code was copied from another project
- Variable `df` was likely renamed to `processeddata` but not updated everywhere
- Lack of proper code review and testing

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Fix 1: Remove problematic import
# Before: from ipynb.fs.full.PCA_analysis import *
# After: # PCA analysis functions will be defined inline or imported from local files

# Fix 2: Fix undefined variable
# Before: zero_cols = [ col for col, is_zero in ((df == 0).sum() == df.shape[0]).items() if is_zero ]
# After: zero_cols = [ col for col, is_zero in ((processeddata == 0).sum() == processeddata.shape[0]).items() if is_zero ]
```

**Benefits**:
- Notebook can now run without import errors
- All variable references are properly defined
- Improved code reliability
- Better debugging experience

## Additional Issues Identified

### Performance Issues:
1. **Inefficient Data Processing**: Multiple loops and redundant operations in data preprocessing
2. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets loaded without consideration for memory constraints
3. **Missing Caching**: Repeated computations that could be cached

### Code Quality Issues:
1. **Inconsistent Naming**: Mixed naming conventions throughout the codebase
2. **Missing Documentation**: Limited inline comments and function documentation
3. **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling for edge cases
4. **Code Duplication**: Similar functions repeated across multiple notebooks

### Security Considerations:
1. **Data Privacy**: No apparent data anonymization or privacy protection
2. **Input Validation**: Limited validation of input data
3. **Output Sanitization**: No apparent sanitization of model outputs

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Code Review Process**: Implement mandatory code review for all notebooks
2. **Testing Framework**: Add unit tests for critical functions
3. **Documentation Standards**: Establish consistent documentation requirements
4. **Version Control**: Use proper branching and commit practices
5. **Environment Management**: Use virtual environments and dependency management
6. **Continuous Integration**: Implement automated testing and validation
