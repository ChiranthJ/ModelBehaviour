Preprocessing:
(Done in Python)
version_1_preprocess.Rmd: R markdown file used for data cleaning and preprocessing. It contains 2 output csv files.
  1)preprocessed.csv: preprocessed and cleaned dataset used for EDA and statistical model.
  2)preprocessed_wosq.csv: preprocessed and cleaned dataset excluding the columns with squared value attributes used for EDA and statistical model.

Note: We have used the preprocessed.csv for further analysis as the removing the squared value features reduced correlation between attributes.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
(Done in R)
EDA.Rmd: R Markdown file that contains preliminary EDA on the preprocessed data and exploratory analysis using visualization.
EDA_FINAL1.html: knit file showing EDA, data visualization and analysis.

Modelling:
(Done in Python)
Models.ipynb : consists of the four models we have used ,i.e, Ridge, XGBoost, Decision Trees and RandomForest Classifiers
From this, the model that was the most well suited was Random Forest.
The models are stored in the folder SavedModels
SavedModels: contains the .sav of all models so that these files can be loaded and tested without fitting the model.
(we have used the module pickle to do so)
eg loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb'))
result = loaded_model.score(X_test, Y_test)
print(result)
filename must be specified
